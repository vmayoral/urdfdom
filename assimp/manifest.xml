    Open Asset Import Library (Short name: Assimp) is a free library to import various well-known 3D model formats 
    into applications. The library has been designed for maximum stability and efficiency. Written in C++, it is 
    licensed under the BSD license. The API is provided for both C and C++. Wrappers for Python and D are available, 
    more bindings are in development.

    The library loads models in a straightforward in-memory format that can be easily read and processed by applications.
