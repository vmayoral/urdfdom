  <description brief="This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to the transform library topic">

    This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to the
    transform library topic. Once the state gets published, it is
    available to all components in the system using the transform
    library.  The package takes the joint angles of the robot as input
    and publishes the 3D poses of the robot links, using a kinematic
    tree model of the robot. The package can both be used as a library
    and as a ROS node.
